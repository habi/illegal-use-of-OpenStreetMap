# Moovit

## Fixing
Can be easily fixed by placing text crediting OSM in bottom right corner, something like `Â© OpenStreetMap contributors` or something similar.

Missing attribution may be also partially remediated by adding something like "Map powered by OpenStreetMap data" at the startup screen.

There is a deeply hidden and insufficient attribution. It is not in a place ever visited by a typical user.

Currently encountering it requires

- enabling sidebar
- scrolling down sidebar
- selecting "Partners" entry
- as bonus, it shows CC-BY-SA as a licence and it is not clear what is credited to OpenStreetMap

## Reported

Reported on the 13th September 2019 (moovitapp.zendesk.com assigned id 343713).

On the 3th October Moovit representative replied claiming that they are consulting with their legal team.

On the 11th November I reminded them that they continue to use OpenStreetMap data illegally.

On the 12th November they claimed that it will be fixed "soon".

On the 27th November I send a next email requesting specifying date when this will be fixed.

## Problem reproduction

1. Install Moovit on an Android phone, run it.
2. Try to find a required attribution.

## Typical Mooovit interface using OpenStreetMap data
