[https://map.snapchat.com/@41.335703,-95.590514,2.00z](https://map.snapchat.com/@41.335703,-95.590514,2.00z) page is missing proper
attribution - it is not made clear that data is from OpenStreetMap and on
the odbl licence.

The same problem applies to the app, linked by ghost icon at the bottom.

Note that OSM attribution according to the odbl licence must be clearly
visible to users, hidden one is not sufficient.
