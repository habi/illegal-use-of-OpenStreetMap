# Snapchat is using OpenStreetMap data illegally

## Reported

I send an [email to Snapchat](mail_to_Snapchat.md) to remind them about licencing obligation and that they are currently commiting a large scale copyright violation. Email was send on 2019-12-23.

[Mapbox report](report_to_Mapbox.md) was send on 2019-12-23 and assigned id 77032 as indicated by an automatic reply.

There is [special form for reporting copyright infringement](https://support.snapchat.com/article/infringement-reporting-about) but it would need to be filled by an official OSMF representative.

On 2020-01-24 I asked also about what kind of date was given as a deadline for Snapchat.

## Reaction of the company

Snapchat failed to react.

Mapbox replied on 2020-01-13 that Mapbox reminded Snapchat about attribution requirements and that they gave Snapchat deadline. Email contained no specific info about the deadline.
