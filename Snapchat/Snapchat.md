I send an [email to Snapchat](mail_to_Snapchat.md) to remind them about licencing obligation and that they are currently commiting a large scale copyright violation.

[Mapbox report](report_to_Mapbox.md) was send on 23th December and assigned id 77032 as indicated by an automatic reply.

There is [special form for reporting copyright infringement](https://support.snapchat.com/article/infringement-reporting-about) but it would need to be filled by an official OSMF representative.
