# Mapsme

## Fixing
Can be easily fixed by replacing misleading attribution "MAPS.ME" in the bottom right corner by `© OpenStreetMap, © Booking.com for misplaced hotels` or `map data except hotel ads © OpenStreetMap` or `map data © OpenStreetMap, © Booking.com for misplaced hotels, style © MAPS.ME` or something similar.

Missing attribution may be also partially remediated by adding something like "Powered by OpenStreetMap data" at the startup screen.

There is a deeply hidden and insufficient attribution. It is not in a place ever visited by a typical user.
