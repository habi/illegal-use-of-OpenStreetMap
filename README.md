OpenStreetMap is a project of mappers who together create map of the world. Created dataset can be used by anyone, for free, for any purpose. There are minimal requirements. Proper attribution is a fundamental one and very easy to fulfill - just mention who provided data that you use.

Unfortunately in many cases users of this great dataset are not attributing OpenStreetMap at all.

This project documents companies involved in this kind of plagiarism. The use OpenStreetMap data on a large scale and try to hide this. Smaller entities especially blatant in their plagiarism also may be listed.

Currently following large scale plagiarisms are documented:

- [MAPS.ME](MAPS.ME/MAPS.ME.md) that is using OpenStreetMap data and attributing it to MAPS.ME. It was reported to this company at 2019-07-10
- [Moovit](Moovit/Moovit.md) that is not attributing OpenStreetMap in their Android application. They are informed about this problem since at least 2019-09-13

# Wait, there is attribution

Some behave like hiding attribution in places where no one will see it count as an attribution. This is not true. Note section 4.3 of the [Open Database License](https://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/)

Hiding attribution in settings, at the bottom, in "[About MAPS.ME](MAPS.ME/MAPS.ME.md)" entry is not

> reasonably calculated to make any Person

# Similar projects

[Lacking proper attribution](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Lacking_proper_attribution) page at the OSM Wiki has a very similar purpose.

Main difference is that this project focuses on documenting cases of especially eggregious, persistent and large scale copyright violations.
