[Lacking proper attribution](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Lacking_proper_attribution) page at OSM Wiki has a very similar purpose.

This project focuses on entities that use OpenStreetMap data on a large scale and try to hide this. Smaller entities especially blatant in their plagiarism also may be listed.

Currently following large scale plagiarisms are documented:

- [MAPS.ME](MAPS.ME/MAPS.ME.md) that is using OpenStreetMap data and attributing it to MAPS.ME. It was reported to this company at 2019-07-10
- [Moovit](Moovit/Moovit.md) that is not attributing OpenStreetMap in their Android application. They are informed about this problem since at least 2019-09-13
